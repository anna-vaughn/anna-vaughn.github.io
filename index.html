                <p> Anna is entering her last year at UNO where she has studied since Fall 2018. 
                    She is majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS) with minors in both Computer Science and Math.
                    The last time she designed a webpage was during her first semester at UNO, so she is excited to brush the dust off
                    of her HTML and CSS skills and learn Python to create even better webpages! Anna is currently an intern at Union Pacific
                    and works in the Fuel and Environmental department to meet their technological needs. Through the internship, she has been
                    certified as a Tableau Desktop Specialist.
                </p>

                <p> Outside of school, Anna likes to knit (mostly hats for preemie babies which get donated to Omaha area hospitals), play video games, read,
                    and annoy the cats in her life. The cat pictured above is Thea. She lives with Anna's parents!
