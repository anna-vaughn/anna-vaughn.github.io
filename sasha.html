                <p> Sasha is a 4 year-old cat adopted by Anna and her boyfriend, Josh, in Janurary 2021. She is currently living with Josh in Lincoln,
                    and hopes that her parents plans to move in together happen soon! Her favorite person is Anna (much to Josh's chagrin). She
                    is a very talkative cat who loves to snuggle with people she trusts!
